# jira-cli-util-lib
jcul (pronounced J. Cole, like the guy who got dissed by Kendrick Lamar circa Apr 2024) is a suite of Lua scripts that execute some nifty tasks and stuff for your Jira workflow through jira-cli (https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli).

TBH I say they're Lua scripts but jk they can be Python/Rust/OCaml (ðŸ‘€). This is just a shared home for shenanigans related to trying to make Jira life less painful.
